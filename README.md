# Project Overview:

The project is a React application designed to help users discover and stay updated on exciting events happening near them. It provides a user-friendly interface for browsing upcoming events, displaying event details, and offering a seamless experience for users to stay informed about local happenings.

## Key Features:

`Header Component:` 
The application includes a header component providing navigation options and branding for easy access to different sections of the application.

`Banner Section:` 
The main landing page features a visually appealing banner section with an SVG image background. This section serves as a focal point for users, presenting a welcoming message and a brief description of the application's purpose.

`Upcoming Events Section:` 
The application displays a list of upcoming events in separate sections. It includes two components, REvents and UEvents, presumably for displaying different types of events. These sections allow users to browse through events, view event details, and stay updated on local activities.

`Event Cards:` 
Each event is represented by a card containing relevant information such as event name, date, location, weather, and distance. The cards are designed to provide a visually appealing and informative layout, enhancing the user experience.

`Infinite Scrolling:` 
The application implements infinite scrolling functionality using the useInView hook to detect when the user scrolls to the end of the page. This feature ensures a seamless browsing experience by dynamically loading more events as the user explores the list.

`API Integration:` 
The application fetches event data from an external API endpoint. It utilizes the fetch API to retrieve event information, allowing users to access up-to-date and relevant event listings.

`Responsive Design:` 
The application is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring optimal viewing and usability across various devices and screen sizes. This responsiveness enhances accessibility and usability for a broader range of users.

Overall, the project aims to provide users with a comprehensive platform for discovering and staying informed about local events. With its user-friendly interface, visually appealing design, and seamless functionality, the application offers an engaging experience for users seeking to explore and participate in upcoming events in their area.
## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

and

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
